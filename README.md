# Weekend Project #4

- Build a web server and API for providing the features using the RESTful architecture
- Run a local node of IPFS
- Upload 10 images to this node
- Create a JSON and build metadata descriptions for 10 NFTs, each using one unique image
- Make a GET method in the API to get the metadata by id
- Deploy a NFT Collection and mint 10 NFTs, and assign the API endpoint to the token URI
- Integrate this NFT Collection contract and APIs in a frontend application to display NFTs metadata and images
- (Bonus) provide wallet functions in the frontend to buy, transfer, allow, transfer from and burn NFTs


#### Token
- Make an NFT token contract with token name "Openlake Token" and symbol "OLT"
- Which gives us a contract Address <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x1abf78bdb77d508d2df026cc8bd73beaaf851ca6" target="_blank">0x1abf78bdb77d508d2df026cc8bd73beaaf851ca6</a>
